battleship game using zero knowledge proofs and hash functions to conceal battleship placements whilst publicly committing to them. Created as part of my MSc. 

it was my first rust project so go easy on me :)

currently unfinished, it only supports battleships of sizes 1x1 and only runs as a single process within one console. I'll eventually expand it to be asynchronous and support more battleship sizes.
